#### INTRODUCTION:
This document provides an overview of Product D, a custom hardware controller meticulously designed to complement and control a Max patch (Cycling 74/Max4Live). Product D features a 6-channel live
sampler and drum sequencer, alongside 4 channels of live looping, offering a robust suite of functionalities for a dynamic and intuitive musical experience. Product D was born from a vision to create a hardware interface that seamlessly integrates with its software counterpart, aiming to enhance the creative process for musicians and producers.

#### VIDEO DEMO:
Given the extensive features of both the Product D and the accompanying Max patch, I've prepared a comprehensive video demonstration. This video showcases key functionalities and highlights how these elements work together in a practical context.
