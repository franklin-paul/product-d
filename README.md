#### INTRODUCTION:
I created a Max patch (Cycling 74/Max4Live) 6 channel live sampler and drum sequencer with 4 channels of live looping. It has a massive suite of features, and I wanted to create a hardware controller designed from the ground-up to work with it in an intuitive and musical way. This is the Product D.
<br/><br/>
#### VIDEO DEMO:
Since the Product D is so large, and the Max patch itself is also rather robust, I have provided a video that highlights some of the main features of each.
